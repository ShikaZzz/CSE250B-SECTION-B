### Note
This repository mainly focuses on five homework assignments assigned during Winter 2019 quarter including theoretical mathematical problems and coding projects. **PLEASE strictly follow the Academic Integrity announced in UCSD**, but original problems and lecture notes will be available. Feel free to email me if you have any problems: liam951120@gmail.com.
